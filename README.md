# DMI_predictor
This repository contains codes to develop, test, and implement a DMI (domain-motif interface) predictor. This program automates the search of domains and motifs in the sequences of interacting proteins. Following that, the program uses a reference list of DMI types to pair potential DMI among the domain and motif matches. These potential DMIs are subsequently scored with a random forest model to allow for the ranking of potential DMI based on their likelihood to be functional.

### The random forest model is trained using the following dataset:
final_PRS_RRSv4_3_used_to_fit_model.tsv: The positive reference set (PRS) and the third replicate of random reference set (RRSv4) used to fit the random forest and median imputer for deployment.

### The final random forest and median imputed fitted for deployment are:
final_RF_model_with_RRSv4_3.joblib: Random forest model fitted on final_PRS_RRSv4_3_used_to_fit_model.tsv.\
final_median_imputer_with_RRSv4_3.joblib: Median imputer fitted on final_PRS_RRSv4_3_used_to_fit_model.tsv.

### The predictor requires some files to run and they are stored in lookup_files folder:
20220311_elm_classes.tsv: List of motif types that the program uses to find motif matches.\
20220311_elm_interaction_domains_complete.tsv: List of DMI types for the pairing of potential DMIs.\
all_pfam/smart_domains_with_frequency.txt: Frequencies of different Pfam domains as features for the scoring of potential DMIs.\
interpro_9606_pfam/smart_matches_20210122.json: JSON file downloaded from InterPro for all domain matching in human protein sequences in SwissProt.

### The scripts to generate different versions of RRS, run the program, analyse features and trained models, as well as precompute different features, are stored in scripts folder.
